# PacMan-Unity

I made an attempt to re-create the original Pac-Man game using Unity. The unique personalities of the ghosts were carefully replicated, just as they are in the original game. I haven't implemented the different time periods of Scatter and Chase modes yet, but I've made sure that each ghost roams in different synchronized states with random periods. All other features function just like they do in the original Pac-Man game, except for the user interface.
